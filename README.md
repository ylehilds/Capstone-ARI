Capstone-ARI

Improved the learning environment for the deaf by developing a prototype that projects an ASL interpreter on a Heads Up Display glasses. Deaf users would be able to watch a Planetarium Show as well as see the interpreter via heads up display glasses. Built a server to communicate video to the Heads Up Display glasses. Created a user interface for testing purposes. This Capstone Project was part of a three years BYU Planetarium deployment plan, NSF funded.
